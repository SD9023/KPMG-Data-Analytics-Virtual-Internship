# KPMG-Data-Analytics-Virtual-Internship
During this KPMG Virtual Internship program, I got an opportunity to step into the shoes of a KPMG team member as a Data Analyst and replicated the tasks completed every day. It helped to build skills and experience on data analysis, Customer Segmentation, Data Dashboards, and problem solving.
# Introduction
Sprocket Central Pty Ltd , a medium size bikes & cycling accessories organisation, has approached Tony Smith (Partner) in KPMG’s Lighthouse & Innovation Team. Sprocket Central Pty Ltd  is keen to learn more about KPMG’s expertise in its Analytics, Information & Modelling team. 

Primarily, Sprocket Central Pty Ltd needs help with its customer and transactions data. The organisation has a large dataset relating to its customers, but their team is unsure how to effectively analyse it to help optimise its marketing strategy.
# Task 1: Data Quality Assessment
The client provided KPMG with 3 datasets:
- Customer Demographic 
- Customer Addresses
- Transactions data in the past 3 months

In this preliminary step, We drafted an email to the client where we identified the data quality issues and strategies to mitigate these issues. 
# Task 2: Data Insights
Sprocket Central Pty Ltd has given us a new list of 1000 potential customers with their demographics and attributes. However, these customers do not have prior transaction history with the organisation. 

The marketing team at Sprocket Central Pty Ltd is sure that, if correctly analysed, the data would reveal useful customer insights which could help optimise resource allocation for targeted marketing. Hence, improve performance by focusing on high value customers.

- In building this recommendation, we started with a PowerPoint presentation which outlines the approach which we will be taking. The client has agreed on a 3 week scope with the following 3 phases as follows - Data Exploration; Model Development and Interpretation.
- Prepared a detailed approach for completing the analysis including activities – i.e. understanding the data distributions, feature engineering, data transformations, modelling, results interpretation and reporting.
