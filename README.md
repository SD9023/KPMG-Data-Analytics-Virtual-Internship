# KPMG-Data-Analytics-Virtual-Internship
During this KPMG Virtual Internship program, I got an opportunity to step into the shoes of a KPMG team member as a Data Analyst and replicated the tasks completed every day. It helped to build skills and experience on data analysis, Customer Segmentation, Data Dashboards, and problem solving.
# Introduction
Sprocket Central Pty Ltd , a medium size bikes & cycling accessories organisation, has approached Tony Smith (Partner) in KPMG’s Lighthouse & Innovation Team. Sprocket Central Pty Ltd  is keen to learn more about KPMG’s expertise in its Analytics, Information & Modelling team. 

Primarily, Sprocket Central Pty Ltd needs help with its customer and transactions data. The organisation has a large dataset relating to its customers, but their team is unsure how to effectively analyse it to help optimise its marketing strategy.
# Task 1: Data Quality Assessment
The client provided KPMG with 3 datasets:
- Customer Demographic 
- Customer Addresses
- Transactions data in the past 3 months

In this preliminary step, We drafted an email to the client where we identified the data quality issues and strategies to mitigate these issues.
